Overview
--------

This program is _incredibly_ niche. If you are running a Unifi network, and you are running a local DNS server outside of the Unifi equipment such as Pi-Hole or AdGuard Home, and that system can read a `hosts.txt` file, then this program might be useful to you.

Usage
-----

```bash
./unifi-dns-scraper -config config.toml
```
